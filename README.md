# PetresEmpireFullStack

Petre's Empire FullStack application

This application was build with Java Spring Boot and MySql for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

In order to run this application, you need to create an angular project, where you will replace the 'src' file with the one I uploaded (the first src in the repository, not the one from the backend).

Also you need to create an MySql table with the script that I wrote in the repository, and then you need to download also the Spring-Boot files and run them.
